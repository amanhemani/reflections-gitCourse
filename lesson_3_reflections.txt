When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating with others
When using multiple machines
When sharing your work
When you would like to have a back up of all commits online






Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To allow you to work on a feature without worry of things changing in the middle
You have more of an idea of the code you are working with, no chance it changed without you knowing
