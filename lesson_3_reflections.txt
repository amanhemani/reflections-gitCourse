When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating with others
When using multiple machines
When sharing your work
When you would like to have a back up of all commits online






Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To allow you to work on a feature without worry of things changing in the middle
You have more of an idea of the code you are working with, no chance it changed without you knowing






Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

branches is when you want to create a separate path of commits
so that the project can be worked on in two different features on different paths
to potentially merge later
Clones are when you copy a repo to a local computer, such as your GitHub repo to a new machine
or an existing local repo to a new location on your computer
Fork is when you copy one GitHub repo to another GitHub account
for you to make your own version of some public code
