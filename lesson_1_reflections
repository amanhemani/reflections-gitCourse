How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

we could see the changes we made from a working version and a new version with errors
From there we can see what line may have caused an issue





How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can see other people's work if the file is collaborative
Restore old versions if current stops working
Use it to compare and debug





What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You get to label your commits
Changes are working and compliable
Makes going over old versions easier to understand
Each commit has a purpose
Less clutter
Less chance of missing something important





Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In code, files are often interdependent on each other
Google Docs' files are often independent of each other and will not impact each other if changed





How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log lets you see an overall history of commits
diff lets you see the changes between commits





How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

If you make a change that has a risk, its okay because you have saved versions of code that does work to back you up





Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
